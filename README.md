# 📊 Real-World Data EDA

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using a real-world dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. This project emphasizes visual techniques like heatmaps, histograms, boxplots, and frequency plots to better understand the dataset.

---

## 🎯 Objective of the Task

The goal of this project is to **perform EDA on a real-world dataset** to answer data-driven questions and generate insights. Specifically, the project focuses on:
- Understanding feature distributions
- Identifying correlations between variables
- Spotting outliers and patterns in frequent values

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **pandas** – for data handling and analysis
- **seaborn** – for visualizations like heatmaps and boxplots
- **matplotlib** – for custom plots and figure control

---

## 🧪 Methodology / Approach

1. **Dataset Loading & Overview**:
   - Load a `.csv` dataset (e.g., Netflix titles, COVID-19 cases, or Housing Prices)
   - Inspect column types and missing values

2. **Top 5 Frequent Values**:
   - Display most common entries in selected columns (e.g., genres, countries)

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate pairwise correlations using `.corr()`
   - Visualize the result using a **heatmap** (seaborn)

4. **Distribution & Spread**:
   - Plot **histograms** for numeric columns to observe skewness and spread
   - Use **boxplots** to detect outliers and compare distributions by category

---

## 📁 Dataset

- The project uses a real-world dataset such as:
  - `netflix_titles.csv`
  - `covid_cases.csv`
  - `housing_prices.csv`

Make sure the dataset includes **categorical** and **numeric** columns for best results.

## 📈 Key Insights / Results

- Strong correlations were observed between [e.g., price and area]
- Some columns (like [genre or country]) were dominated by a few top values
- Outliers were visible in features like [budget, age, or salary]

## 💡 Skills Gained

- Exploratory data analysis using pandas
- Visual storytelling with seaborn and matplotlib
- Identifying trends, outliers, and patterns
- Summarizing data insights visually and numerically
